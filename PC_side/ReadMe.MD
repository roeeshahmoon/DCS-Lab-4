# Serial Communication Script

This Python script demonstrates serial communication between a computer and an external device. It provides a menu-based interface to control various actions such as blinking an RGB LED, displaying data on an LCD screen, generating tones using a buzzer, and more.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your computer. If not, you can download it from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org).

2. Install the `pyserial` library by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

3. Connect the external device to your computer using a serial port. Make a note of the correct serial port for your device.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. Run the script by executing the following command:

4. After running the script, a menu will be displayed in the terminal.

5. Enter the corresponding menu number to perform the desired action. The available menu options are as follows:

1. **Blink RGB LED**: This option allows you to blink an RGB LED color by color with a specified delay in milliseconds.

2. **Count up onto LCD screen**: Choose this option to display a count-up sequence on an LCD screen with a specified delay in milliseconds.

3. **Circular tone series via Buzzer**: Select this option to generate a circular tone series using a buzzer with a specified delay in milliseconds.

4. **Get delay time**: Use this option to set the delay time for the previous menu options. Enter the desired delay time in milliseconds when prompted.

5. **LDR 3-digit value onto LCD**: This option displays the value from an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) onto an LCD screen.

6. **Clear LCD screen**: Choose this option to clear the contents displayed on the LCD screen.

7. **Show menu**: Select this option to display the menu again.

8. **Sleep**: This option allows the program to sleep for a while.

6. Follow the on-screen instructions and prompts to interact with the external device.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues with the serial communication, ensure that you have selected the correct serial port in the script (`s = ser.Serial('COM1', ...)`). Modify it according to your specific setup.

- Double-check the connections between your computer and the external device to ensure they are properly established.

## Limitations

- This script assumes the use of a Windows operating system, as it references COM ports. If you are using a different operating system, modify the serial port configuration accordingly.

- Make sure the external device is compatible with the commands and communication protocol used in the script.

That's it! You now have the necessary information to set up and use the serial communication script. Enjoy exploring the various functionalities!
